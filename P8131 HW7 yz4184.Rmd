# (a) Exploratory analysis
## provide boxplots to show the relation between gender/attitude and pitch (ignoring different scenarios).

# (b)
## Fit a mixed effects model with random intercepts for different subjects (gender and attitude being the fixed effects).

```{r}
LMM1 <- lme (frequency ~ gender + attitude, random = ~1 | subject,  data = pitch_df, method='REML') 
summary (LMM1)
```


## What is the covariance matrix for a subject Yi?

```{r}
VarCorr(LMM1)
VarCorr(LMM1)[1]
VarCorr(LMM1)[2]
```

sigma_b^2 + sigma^2 = 598.1953 + 847.7049 = 1445.9







## What is the covariance matrix for the estimates of fixed effects?

```{r}
vcov(LMM1)
```


## What are the BLUPs for subject-specific intercepts?

```{r}
random.effects(LMM1)
```


## What are the residuals?

```{r}
pitch_df$frequency-fitted(LMM1)
```

# (c)
## Fit a mixed effects model with intercepts for different subjects (gender, attitude and their interaction being the fixed effects).

```{r}

summary (LMM2)

## Use likelihood ratio test to compare this model with the model in part (b) to determine whether the interaction term is significantly associated with pitch.

```{r}
LMM.1 <- lme (frequency ~ gender + attitude, random = ~1 | subject,  data = pitch_df, method='ML')

LMM.2 <- lme (frequency ~ gender * attitude, random = ~1 | subject,  data = pitch_df, method='ML')

# (d)
## Write out the mixed effects model with random intercepts for both subjects and scenarios (gender and attitude being the fixed effects).




##  Fit the model using lmer in the lme4 package.

```{r}
LMM3 = lmer(frequency ~ gender + attitude + (1 | subject) +  (1 | scenario), data = pitch_df)

## What is the interpretation of the coefficient for the fixed effect term attitude?
